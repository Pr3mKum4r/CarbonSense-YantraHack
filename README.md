## Introduction

Environmental degradation is one of the biggest challenges faced by our world today. **CarbonSense** aims to address this by providing an easy-to-deploy solution that monitors carbon emissions, helping users keep track of air quality in their surroundings.

The system collects real-time data on carbon dioxide levels and analyzes patterns to suggest corrective measures. The insights obtained can be applied across industries for proactive decision-making to reduce environmental impact.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Monitoring**: Tracks CO2 levels in real-time using sensors.
- **Data Visualization**: Presents data in an easily understandable format for users.
- **Alerts**: Sends alerts when CO2 levels cross specific thresholds.
- **Environmental Insights**: Provides insights and suggestions based on recorded data to improve air quality.

## Technology Stack

- **Hardware**: CO2 sensors
- **Microcontroller**: [Specify microcontroller, e.g., ESP32]
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C/C++
- **Backend**: [Specify backend if used, e.g., Node.js, Firebase]
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for data visualization
- **APIs**: REST APIs for data handling and alert notifications

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Platform-specific SDK/Tools] (e.g., ESP-IDF, Arduino IDE)

### Usage

- Start the microcontroller with the CO2 sensor connected.
- Run the backend server and open the frontend application to monitor real-time data.
